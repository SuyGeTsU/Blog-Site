                <h4>God Of Miracles</h4>
                <b>By Samantha Brooks , 02-04-2024</b>
                <p>
                    Can you imagine the scene? Jesus just learning of the death of His cousin, John the Baptist, resting
                    and most likely praying in the hill country of Golan Heights. The weight of His loss could not
                    compare with His compassion for His people as He looked up and saw the large crowd.
                    The first thought Jesus has about this crowd is not, "Why are they here, don't they know that I am
                    in morning!" Jesus' first thought is compassion and He moves in healing and teaching.

                <h4>Ryan Gosling Nervously Rehearses His Meet Cool With Chris Stapleton in ‘SNL’ Promo</h4>
                <b>By Gil Kaufmann , 04/10/2024</b>
                <p>
                    Ryan Gosling has been a star for more than three decades. And, judging by the way he absolutely
                    crushed it during the mega song-and-dance performance of his spotlight Barbie song “I’m Just Ken”

                <h4>IPL 2024 youngster</h4>
                <b>By Mohsin Kamal , 01-04-2024</b>
                <p>
                    "Speed” is the word that has dominated the headlines in Indian cricket circles since March 30. In
                    the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL), Lucknow Super Giants were hosting Punjab Kings at Ekana
                    Stadium and things were going great for Punjab. They were 88 for none in nine overs, chasing 200.

                    Then Lucknow brought on Mayank Yadav, a name that was unheard of, at least for people who did not
                    follow India’s domestic cricket. A young pacer debuting in the world’s most-watched cricket league
                    is a challenging experience. Still, before people could say anything about him, everyone suddenly
                    started noticing the speedometer.

                <h4>Liam Gallagher and John Squire Spin ‘I’m A Wheel’ For Late-Night TV</h4>
                <b>By Lars Brandel , 04/10/2024</b>
                <p>
                    Manchester, for any music (or sport) fan who knows their stuff, is a city that punches several
                    divisions above its weight. For its part in the spread of electronic dance music through the U.K. in
                    the late ‘80s, and the peerless, timeless bands that emerged from its scene — think The Smiths, Joy
                    Division/New Order, Happy Mondays — Manchester is one of the world’s great music cities.

                <p>
                    It's always a pleasure to watch the top two contenders make it to the final and then for the best
                    man to walk away with the ultimate prize. Of course to be able to really enjoy that we have to first
                    be able put aside our biases, as a contest between the best is always a mouthwatering prospect but a
                    hell lot of a times it comes at the expense of one's own preferred candidate.

                    this magical voice belonged to. Arijit became the melody king, and his songs turned into anthems for
